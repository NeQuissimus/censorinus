# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2016-03-01

### Changed
* Move packages around to make publishing in non-github-repo-of-gphat's easier. The package is now `github.gphat`. Thanks [tixxit](https://github.com/tixxit)!
* Use a BlockingQueue to simplify the asynchronous mode. Thanks [tixxit](https://github.com/tixxit)!
* Speed up metric emission by using a `StringBuilder` instead of Scala string interpolation. Thanks [tixxit](https://github.com/tixxit)!
* Removed the `histogram` method from the `StatsDClient` as it's not a supported metric type.

# Fixed
* Datadog histograms and timers now emit sample rates. Previously they did not, which was a bug!
* Small doc fixes.

## [1.0.2] - 2016-02-22

## Fixed
* Stopped `println`ing every Metric send via UDP. So chatty!
* Ahemâ€¦ so client-side sampling wasn't really working. Sampling now works 100% better. There's a test to prove it!

## Added
* Ability to bypass the client-side sampler, but still send a sample rate. This is useful for folks doing their own sampler.

## [1.0.1] - 2016-02-20

### Fixed
* Double values being emitted as scientific notation and therefore being invalid StatsD datagrams
* Shutdown client in test suite so unclosed DatagramSockets don't pile up
* Adjust DogStatsD encoder to only add pipe delimiters when necessary

### Added
* Test to ensure DogStatsD datagrams are correctly formatted. Fixes #3
* Added optional prefix argument for clients to add to the names of metrics. Fixes #1

## [1.0.0] - 2016-02-11

* First release!
